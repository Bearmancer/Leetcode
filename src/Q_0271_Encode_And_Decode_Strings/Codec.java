 * Implementation Notes (Standardized Deep-Dive)
 * =============================================
 *
 * Design rationale
 * ----------------
 * This solution prioritizes correctness first, then readability, then optimization.
 * The algorithmic strategy is encoded directly in the method-level control flow
 * and helper abstractions below.
 *
 * Pros
 * ----
 * - Clear step-by-step control flow and predictable behavior.
 * - Uses standard Java data structures and idiomatic patterns.
 * - Easy to validate with examples and edge-case reasoning.
 *
 * Cons
 * ----
 * - May not be the asymptotically optimal variant for every input shape.
 * - Can trade some runtime efficiency for readability and maintainability.
 * - Data-structure overhead (boxing/object metadata) may affect large inputs.
 *
 * Time complexity
 * ---------------
 * Let n be input size and m be auxiliary structure size where applicable.
 * Complexity depends on the selected control-flow path and operations below.
 * The dominant terms come from loops, recursion depth, sorting/heap operations,
 * and map/set lookups used in the implemented path.
 *
 * Space complexity
 * ----------------
 * Auxiliary space depends on helper data structures and recursion stack depth
 * used by this implementation path.
 *
 * Overhead discussion
 * -------------------
 * - Object allocation and collection growth can contribute constant-factor costs.
 * - Hash-based and tree-based containers trade memory for operational speed.
 * - Intermediate containers improve clarity but can add temporary allocation cost.
 *
 * Future optimizations
 * --------------------
 * - Replace full-order operations with top-k or partial-order variants when possible.
 * - Reduce temporary allocations by reusing buffers/containers.
 * - Consider primitive-specialized structures for hot paths to reduce boxing overhead.
 *
 * ASCII execution model
 * ---------------------
 * Input -> Preprocess -> Core Transform -> Optional Ordering/Selection -> Output
 *
